Class: BodyPart

The BodyPart class organizes anatomical components into a structured hierarchy based on major regions of the body. The main subclasses are Arms, Core, Head, and Legs, each representing a distinct body area.

- Arms are broken down into ArmBones, ArmMuscles, and ArmTendons, detailing the skeletal, muscular, and connective tissues involved in arm function.

- Core includes CoreBones, CoreMuscles, and CoreOrgans, encompassing the central structures like the spine, abdominal muscles (abs), and vital organs.

- Head is subdivided into HeadBones and HeadOrgans, covering cranial bones and sensory organs such as the brain and eyes.

- Legs consist of LegBones, LegMuscles, and LegsTendons, focusing on the components essential for locomotion.
