Class: Sport

The Sport class categorizes physical activities based on the nature of participant interaction and physical demands. It is divided into ContactSport and NonContactSport.

ContactSport is further split into:
- SpeedBasedContactSport: Sports where speed is crucial, and physical contact occurs (e.g., rugby).
- StrengthBasedContactSport: Sports emphasizing strength with physical contact (e.g., wrestling).

NonContactSport is divided into:
1. Repetitive: Activities involving repeated movements.
- SpeedBasedRepetitive: Emphasizing speed (e.g., running).
- StrengthBasedRepetitive: Emphasizing strength (e.g., weightlifting).

2. NonRepetitive: Activities with varied movements.
- SpeedBasedNonRepetitive: Speed-focused but varied (e.g., running).
- StrengthBasedNonRepetitive: Strength-focused with varied movements (e.g., rock climbing).

This detailed classification supports nuanced understanding and reasoning about sports, their physical requirements, and potential health implications within the ontology.
