Class: Location

The Location class categorizes geographical entities to provide spatial context within the ontology. It is divided into Countries and Geography.

Geography is further subdivided into Biomes, Land, and Water.

- Biomes include Aquatic and Terrestrial, representing major ecological zones.

- Land comprises Continents, Islands, and MountainRanges, detailing significant landforms.

- Water encompasses Ocean, River, and Sea, covering various bodies of water.

By structuring locations in this way, the ontology can effectively link other classes (like animals or recipes) to specific places, enhancing environmental and cultural associations.
